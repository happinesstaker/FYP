As the stock price volatility aptly shows, the usual volatility of lumpy order flow associated with the space, lack of profitability and doubts over competitive positioning took the sheen away quickly.\nWith the stock trading near half the trading multiple of other players, while expecting to deliver almost twice the growth, there is hardly any premium attached for the comeback, which may change soon, especially as the trend of the last two quarters takes hold with the help of new products, the successful push into the cloud and the demand for more security laced features. Besides the improving fundamentals, the business, as a pure-play ADC player, should be high on any acquisition target list related to the space.\nConcerns, including competition, seem overdone\nIn late 2012, Cisco exited the ADC market and partnered with Citrix ( CTXS ) instead, which was not very surprising to some, since F5 and Citrix were handily beating the company, but more importantly, the void created by the exit invited various new players, including A10. Since the A10 team came from Foundry Networks, now part of Brocade ( BRCD ), the company was a serious contender, but F5's comprehensive refresh of its product line up increased the competitive pressure significantly for the newcomer - A10.\nThe historical perspective is important for two things. First of all, bigger players relative to A10 with a lopsided market share, currently in favor of F5, dominate the market, and secondly, the market is technically driven enough to experience swings, including away from a large player like Cisco. This offers a fighting chance to even a small company like A10.\nGoing forward, A10, as backed by the top line growth, seems to be creating a unique position for itself among 'pure-plays', even though F5 remains a dominant player, especially in large-scale deployments, and the rest of the market consisting of just a handful of 'pure' players and largely diversified networking players. The market is shifting away from just hardware and software based solutions, with the growth of virtual ADCs, demand from fast growing cloud as well as software defined data centers, creating opportunities for a land grab. The demand for security functionality is becoming another major differentiator. In such an environment, it may not come as a surprise that F5 missed expectations and lowered guidance in the most recent quarter.\nGrowth catalysts just flexing muscles\nRevenue Growth\n", "title": "A10 Networks Deserves More Than A Single Digit"}, {"article": "Understanding Cisco\u2019s Future Growth Prospects  (Part 2 of 3)\nFactors that Can Drive Cisco Systems\u2019 Growth\nBy Paige Tanner \u00a0\u2022 Nov 13, 2015    5:41 pm EST\nRevenue by product\nIn the previous part of this series, we saw that Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) reported strong results for its fiscal 1Q16 results. Of its $12.7 billion revenue, Cisco derived 78% of its revenue, or $9.84 billion, from its wide product portfolio\u00a0and 22%, or $2.84 billion, from services.\nThe company\u2019s revenue was driven by a rebound in Switching products as well as strong growth in Collaboration and Data Center products. All other segments also reported growth, except NGN Routing and Service Provider Video.\u00a0The company earns revenue from nine business segments, with maximum revenue earned from Switching and Routing.\nEnlarge Graph\nSwitching\nFor the past few quarters, Cisco\u2019s Switching business has reported lackluster growth. However, in fiscal 1Q16, sales rebounded and the segment reported 5% YoY (year-over-year) growth, which is higher than the 2% YoY growth reported in fiscal 4Q15.\nIn the fiscal 1Q16 earnings call, Cisco\u2019s new CEO, Chuck Robbins, stated that he expects the sales of the new-generation switches to surpass sales of \u00a0old switches. He added that he expects these sales to hit \u201cthat inflection point\u201d in the second half of fiscal 2016.\nCollaboration\nCisco\u2019s Collaboration\u00a0business reported 17% YoY revenue growth in fiscal 1Q16.\u00a0This segment includes new products such as unified communications, conferencing, Cisco telepresence systems, and enterprise mobile messaging.\nData Center\nCisco\u2019s Data Center was the company\u2019s fastest-growing segment, reporting 24% YoY growth. This segment comprises the UCS (unified computing system) that integrates computing, storage, and networking.\nAlthough the company does not have its own storage products, it has partnered with EMC ( EMC ), NetApp ( NTAP ), Hitachi, and IBM ( IBM ) to offer their storage products in UCS.\nWireless and Security\nOn a YoY basis, Cisco\u2019s revenue from both its Wireless and Security businesses grew 7% each. The company is focusing on its Security segment to drive future growth. During the quarter, the company agreed to acquire Lancope, OpenDNS, Pawaa Software, and Portcullis to boost its Security business. All the acquisitions are\u00a0expected to close in fiscal 2Q16.\nNGN Routing and Service Provider Video\nNot all of Cisco\u2019s segments reported growth. The company\u2019s Routing business reported 8% YoY decline in revenue in fiscal 1Q16 after posting 3% YoY growth in fiscal 4Q15. Edward Jones analyst Dave Heger attributed the negative growth\u00a0to the changes in telecom\u00a0service providers\u2019 spending plans. Another struggling segment was Video Equipment, which reported a YoY decline of 2%.\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) invests ~0.77% of its holdings in Cisco.\nTech, Media, and Telecom Performance\n{\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"XLK\",\"CSCO\",\"EMC\",\"IBM\",\"NTAP\",\"SPY\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Technology SPDR (ETF)\",\"Cisco Systems, Inc.\",\"EMC Corporation\",\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"NetApp Inc.\",\"SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\"]}\n31,443 people are subscribed to Market Realist newsletters.\nTo get this newsletter simply fill-in your email address:\nWe don't spam\n", "title": " Factors that Can Drive Cisco Systems&amp;#8217; Growth "}, {"article": "Understanding Cisco\u2019s Future Growth Prospects  (Part 1 of 3)\nWhy Did Cisco Shares Fall 5% despite Upbeat Earnings?\nBy Paige Tanner \u00a0\u2022 Nov 13, 2015    5:40 pm EST\nCisco beats analysts\u2019 estimates\nNetworking giant Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) reported its fiscal 1Q16 earnings on November 12, 2015, after the markets closed. The company\u2019s revenue rose 3.6% YoY (year-over-year) to $12.68 billion in fiscal 1Q16, beating the consensus estimate of $12.65 billion and topping its own forecast for $12.65 billion.\nThe company\u2019s non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) EPS (earnings per share) rose 9.3% YoY to $0.59, beating the analysts\u2019 estimates of $0.56.\nEnlarge Graph\nCisco\u2019s shares fall\nDespite upbeat fiscal 1Q16 results, Cisco\u2019s shares fell 4.96% to $27.83 in the after-hours trading session on November 12, 2015. The shares fell as the company posted weaker guidance for fiscal 2Q16 due to unfavorable macroeconomic factors.\nPlus, currency exchange issues across the Asia\u2013Pacific region impacted Cisco\u2019s order book. We will evaluate the company\u2019s guidance in detail later in this series.\nRevenue trend\nAs a networking hardware provider, Cisco Systems faces business cycle shifts before some of its peers experience these shifts. After several quarters of depressed results, revenues started to pick up in the latter half of fiscal 2015, as seen in the above graph.\nThe company\u2019s fiscal 1Q16 revenues were driven by a rebound in the switching sector, which occurred after months of decline and faster growth in new products such as conferencing hardware and software. We will analyze each segment in detail in the next part of this series.\nProfitability\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Cisco\u2019s gross margin rose from 62.3% in fiscal 1Q15 to 63.20% in fiscal 1Q16. The company\u2019s operating margin improved from 19.13% in fiscal 1Q15 to 24.30% in fiscal 1Q16 as operating expenses fell 4.77% YoY. Net income increased 33% YoY to $2.43 billion.\nCash position\nIn fiscal 1Q16, Cisco ( CSCO ) generated $2.8 billion in cash from operating activities, up 11% YoY. The company spent $1.1 billion in dividend payments and $1.2 billion in share buybacks. As of October 24, 2015, the company\u2019s total cash reserves stood at $59.1 billion, of which only $5 billion was available in the United States.\u00a0This shows the company\u2019s sensitivity to foreign currency fluctuations.\nThe company\u2019s leadership changed hands in July 2015, when Chuck Robbins became CEO after John Chambers stepped down after 20 years. Robbins utilized partnerships instead of acquisitions to drive growth. Recently, the company entered into a strategic partnership with Apple ( AAPL ) and Ericsson ( ERIC ). The Cisco\u2013Ericsson deal negatively impacted Juniper ( JNPR ), which was an acquisition target for Ericsson.\nInvestors can gain diversified exposure to Cisco through the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF ( QQQ ). QQQ has ~2.67% of its holdings in the company\u2019s stock.\nTech, Media, and Telecom Performance\n{\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"XLK\",\"AAPL\",\"CSCO\",\"ERIC\",\"JNPR\",\"QQQ\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Technology SPDR (ETF)\",\"Apple Inc.\",\"Cisco Systems, Inc.\",null,\"Juniper Networks, Inc.\",\"PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)\"]}\nThe Realist Discussions\nJohn Miller\nAlthough disappointed over the negative stock price swing today, I remain a proud stock holder, and I continue to trust in CISCO as the provider of the BEST networking products and services in the world. I look forward to CISCO\u2019s growth under the new leadership of Mr. Robbins. He was very impressive this week on all of his multiple TV interviews.\n1 Comment\n", "title": " Why Did Cisco Shares Fall 5% despite Upbeat Earnings? "}, {"article": "Cisco Systems Inc. and Fossil Group Inc. Drop as Stocks End a Brutal Week\nBy Motley Fool ,\u00a0 November 13, 2015, 08:11:02 PM EDT\nSubscribe\nStock ended lower by more than 1% today, capping a rough     week for U.S. markets. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\u00a0lost 1.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average \u00a0(DJINDICES: ^DJI) gave up 1.1%. Stocks shed nearly 4% in     the past five trading days:\n^INX data by YCharts\nAn interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, its first     boost since 2006, seems likely in the next few weeks. 92% of     economists polled by The Wall Street Journal today said they     expect the increase to come in December.\nMeanwhile, several stocks made sharp moves today including     Dow member Cisco Systems and struggling watch and accessories maker Fossil , which each reported quarterly earnings results before the     opening bell.\nCisco sees a weak fourth quarter ahead\nNetwork technology giant Cisco Systems was the Dow's biggest     percentage-point loser today, falling 6% after its fiscal     first-quarter earnings announcement disappointed investors. The operating results weren't the problem. In fact, Cisco's 4% sales growth was at     the high end of management's guidance and just ahead of Wall     Street's expectations. Profits also came in ahead of plan at     $0.59 per share compared to consensus estimates of $0.56 per     share. \"Q1 was a very strong quarter,\" CEO Chuck Robbins said     in a press release\u00a0.\nHowever, Cisco's soft outlook for the current quarter was     surprisingly weak. While still calling for growth, a recent     slowdown in orders has management feeling conservative about     the next few months. \"Our guidance reflects lower than expected     order growth in Q1, driven largely by the uncertainty of the     macro environment and currency impacts,\" Robbins said. Cisco's     projected 1% revenue gain was well below the 5% consensus that     Wall Street analysts had wanted. And its expected $0.54 per     share of earnings also came up short (estimates centered on     $0.56 per share).\nIn a conference call with investors last night, Cisco's     management said the company is moving quickly to adjust to the     changing demands of its customers, for example by releasing new     products at a 25% faster pace than the prior year and by     aggressively moving into the cloud business. \"We expect the     results of these moves will start showing up in the coming     quarters,\" Robbins said.\nFossil struggles against tech disruptors\nFashion accessory maker Fossil saw its stock crater by 37%     today on 20 times its average daily trading volume. The     catalyst for that huge swing was a third-quarter earnings report that showed evidence of a fundamental shift in the company's     biggest market: watches.\nImage source: Fossil.\nAn 11% decline in the watch category was the main driver of     a 16% overall sales drop, which was well below management's     plan. Net income plunged to $58 million from $104 million in     the year-ago period. \"We are not satisfied with our overall     performance,\" CEO Kosta Kartsotis said in a press     release\u00a0.\nIn a subsequent conference call with investors, executives     described what they saw as a broad move by customers away from     traditional timepieces and toward wearable technology. This     shift is putting pressure on sales growth, but the resulting     tech opportunity is why the company just purchased fitness     tracker producer, Misfit. \"We believe some of the headwinds we     have been experiencing result from a lack of technology in our     core business, and this acquisition will allow us to quickly     start turning those headwinds into tailwinds\u00a0.\"\nAny turnaround will have to wait until at least next year,     though. Fossil lowered its sales and profit outlook and said it     expects revenue to sink by as much as 11% next quarter.     Earnings are now projected to fall 17% for the full year, down     to $5.90 per share.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret\nThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something       at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's       powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in       technology.

(CSCO) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) has fallen towards $26 after beating FQ1 estimates, offering soft FQ2 guidance, and reporting 3% Y/Y product order growth (less than expected) due to a 3% drop in enterprise orders. Several firms have cut their targets, but no downgrades have arrived.\n\"While weaker macro trends certainly played a role, we believe there is more to the story,\" writes Guggenheim's Ryan Hutchinson (Neutral). \"Our checks suggest that, despite management\u2019s statements to the contrary, the weak enterprise outlook is partially a result of uncertainty around future network architectures as more workloads migrate to the cloud. With this added risk to Cisco\u2019s top-line outlook, we see little reason for shares to move higher\"\nMacquarie's Rajesh Ghai (Underperform) thinks Cisco's 8% Y/Y routing revenue decline reflects \"secular pressures\" seen as carriers consider adopting network functions virtualization (NFV - allows networking functions to be delivered via software installed on commodity hardware) at the network edge.\nMeanwhile, Credit Suisse's Kulbinder Garcha (Underperform) believes Cisco is \"increasingly making a trade off in optimizing margins versus pursuing growth\" as rival software-defined networking (SDN) platforms encroach. \"We acknowledge that the adoption of SDN will take time, but will shrink gross profit dollars for the networking stack.\"\nThose more bullish often highlight Cisco's strong software/subscription growth. Raymond James' Simon Leopold (Outperform): \"The 36% y/y growth in software and subscription deferred revenue, and 10% y/y growth in total deferred revenue highlights Cisco\u2019s shift towards a more software-centric business.\" Software growth drove a 31% increase in security deferred revenue.\nBMO's Tim Long (Outperform): \"There were many positives in the quarter, including very strong margins, uptake of new products, impressive growth in subscription-based product deferred, switching, data center, and a rebound in emerging markets.\" Drexel Hamilton's Brian White (Buy) notes Cisco plans to announce a co-developed project with a major web-scale data center owner next week.\nOn the earnings call ( transcript ), Cisco stated emerging markets orders grew a healthy 11% Y/Y, with China (weak in recent years) and India up over 40%. Service provider and commercial (SMB) orders respectively grew 6% and 7%, while public sector orders were flat. Asia-Pac markets outside of China and India were weak.\nSeparately, CEO Chuck Robbins says Cisco won't be responding to the Dell/EMC deal with a giant acquisition of its own, and would only look for \"small strategic\" deals. \"My personal opinion is that the market is moving too fast for these big mergers to be effective.\" There has been speculation Cisco would respond to Dell/EMC by acquiring EMC rival NetApp ( NTAP -1.7%), which is currently worth $9.2B.\n", "title": "Cisco -6.4%; bears fret over technology shifts; bulls talk up software/subscriptions"}, {"article": "Subscribe\n(RTTNews.com) - After moving notably lower earlier in the session, stocks continue to see significant weakness in mid-day trading on Friday. The losses on the day are extending a recent downtrend by the broader markets, with the S&P 500 moving lower for the seventh time in eight sessions.\nCurrently, the major averages are off their worst levels of the day but still firmly in the red. The Dow is down 106.16 points or 0.6 percent at 17,341.91, the Nasdaq is down 37.29 points or 0.8 percent at 4,967.79 and the S&P 500 is down 10.35 points or 0.5 percent at 2,035.62.\nThe continued weakness on Wall Street comes following the release of a report from the Commerce Department showing U.S. retail sales rose less than expected in the month of October.\nThe report said retail sales inched up by 0.1 percent in October, while revised data showed that sales were virtually unchanged in September. Economists had expected sales to climb by 0.3 percent.\nExcluding a pullback in auto sales, retail sales rose by 0.2 percent in October following a revised 0.4 percent drop in September. Ex-auto sales were expected to increase by 0.4 percent.\nWhile a separate Labor Department report showed an unexpected drop in producer prices in October, analysts said the data shouldn't prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates next month.\nThe Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand fell by 0.4 percent in October after sliding by 0.5 percent in September. Economists had expected the index to rise by 0.2 percent.\nExcluding food and energy prices, core producer prices still dropped by 0.3 percent, matching the decrease seen in the previous month. Core prices had been expected to inch up by 0.1 percent.\nMeanwhile, traders have largely shrugged off a report from the University of Michigan showing a bigger than expected improvement in consumer sentiment in November.\nThe University of Michigan said the preliminary reading on its consumer sentiment index for November rose to 93.1 from the final October reading of 90.0. Economists had expected the index to climb to 92.0.\nSector News\nRetail stocks continue to turn in some of the worst performances on the day following the disappointing sales data. The Dow Jones Retail Index has tumbled by 2 percent to its lowest intraday level in over a month.\nUpscale fashion retailer Nordstrom ( JWN ) is posting a particularly steep loss after reporting weaker than expected third quarter earnings and lowering its full-year guidance. GameStop ( GME ) and J.C. Penney ( JCP ) are also falling sharply.\nSubstantial weakness is also visible among networking stocks, as reflected by the 1.7 percent loss being posted by the NYSE Arca Networking Index. Cisco ( CSCO ) is leading the way lower after reporting better than expected fiscal first quarter results but providing disappointing guidance.\nReflecting weakness in the broader technology sector, software, internet, and computer hardware stocks are also moving notably lower.\nOn the other hand, biotechnology stocks are bucking the downtrend, with the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index climbing by 1.7 percent. Illumina ( ILMN ) is posting a strong gain on news it will replace Sigma-Aldrich (SIAL) in the S&P 500 Index.\nOther Markets\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower following the overnight weakness on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.5 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plunged by 2.2 percent.\nThe major European markets also came under pressure on the day. While the German DAX Index dropped by 0.7 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both slumped by 1 percent.\nIn the bond market, treasuries have moved to the upside on the heels of the disappointing retail sales data.

The company blamed this on a     combination of adverse foreign exchange issues and     macro-economic challenges. However, there is a lot more going     under the surface of these results, so let's take a closer     look.\nCisco Systems first-quarter results: The raw numbers\nTotal revenue growth of 3.6% came in near the top end of     management's 2% to 4% guidance range, while non-GAAP EPS rose     9.3% to $0.59 and was ahead of the $0.55 to $0.57 forecast on     the first-quarter earnings call. Non-GAAP net income rose 7.9%     year over year. As you can see below, product sales growth     outpaced services growth in the quarter.\nRevenue\n61.8%\nData source: Cisco presentations. Dollar figures in     millions.\nMeanwhile, deferred revenue -- important because it measures     advance payments for services or products that haven't been     delivered yet -- continued to grow at a double-digit rate with     10.3% growth in the quarter.\nData source: Cisco presentations. Figures in millions of     dollars.\nTurning to revenue growth by product line, as the graph     below indicates, it was clearly a difficult quarter for its     next-generation network routing business, where revenue     declined 8%. Switching (up 4.6%) and NGN routing are Cisco's     core product lines, representing 30% and 16% of 2015 sales,     respectively. Moreover, as noted earlier, services growth of 1%     was a notable slowdown from previous quarters.\nThis chart of yearly revenue growth by quarter shows the     trends in Cisco's businesses.\nData source: Cisco presentations. Growth figures on a     year-on-year basis.\nNow, the all-important second-quarter guidance:\nRevenue growth will be in the range of 0% to 2%, compared       to last year's second quarter.\nNon-GAAP EPS forecast to be $0.53 to $0.55, compared to       last year's second-quarter figure of $0.54.\nThe revenue guidance represents a slowdown in growth, which     CEO Chuck Robbins outlined in the earnings release. \"We guided     to solid growth in Q2. Our guidance reflects lower than     expected order growth in Q1, driven largely by the uncertainty     of the macro environment and currency impacts.\"\nWhat happened with Cisco Systems in the       quarter\nWeakness in service revenue growth was \"largely isolated\"       to service providers, according to CFO Kellly Kramer on the       earnings call.\nThe services segment's deferred revenue was up 7% in the       quarter.\nRobbins claimed routing weakness was a \"timing issue\"       related to the introduction of new products due soon, and       feels \"pretty reasonably well about our routing performance       over the coming quarters.\"\nSwitching revenue will pass an \"inflection point\" in the       second half as next-generation data center switching revenue       offsets declines in historical data center switching,       according to Robbins.\nEnterprise orders declined 3% in the quarter due to       \"macro challenges,\" with management signaling weakness       outside the U.S. \"and particularly in Asia-Pacific.\" Canada       and Latin America were also weak.\nPublic sector orders were flat, with service provider up       6% and commercial up 7%. Total orders were up 3% in the       quarter.\nFree cash flow of $2.5 billion was up 13.5% compared to       the same period last year, and represents 83% conversion from non-GAAP net income.\nLooking ahead\nCisco can't do much about the macro environment, but investors     should keep an eye on U.S. enterprise growth in the coming     quarter. Robbins declared he was \"very comfortable with the     situation,\" but any deterioration would indicate that Cisco's     issues go beyond the economic slowdown in emerging markets.\nOn a granular level, management expects NGN routing growth     to improve as new products are sold, and services revenue     should improve, given the 7% increase in deferred revenue. Like     many other companies exposed to emerging markets, Cisco needs     to adjust to a lower level of growth in the coming     quarters.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret\nThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something       at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the       Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's       powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in       technology.

The tepid outlook dampened investors' mood, sending shares of Cisco tumbling nearly 5% in aftermarket hours.\nCisco Q1 Results in Focus\nEarnings of 54 cents per share came in three cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues rose 3.6% year over year to $12.68 billion and were ahead of our estimate of $12.64 billion. This represents the eight consecutive quarter of revenue beat. The better-than-expected performance was primarily driven by software and cloud strategies (read: Decent Cloud Computing Earnings Put This ETF in Focus ).\nThe world's largest network equipment maker expects revenues to grow 0-2% year over year and earnings per share in the range of 53-55 cents in the ongoing second fiscal quarter. The guidance reflects a slowdown in order growth, citing global uncertainty and negative currency translations. Further, the midpoint of earnings per share guidance is much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents.\nThe networking leader is focusing on high-end switches and routers, and investing in new products such as data analytics software and cloud-based tools for data centers through acquisitions. The company recently completed the acquisition of OpenDNS, MaintenanceNet, and Pawaa Software and announced the acquisitions of Portcullis, ParStream, Lancope, and 1 Mainstream, all of which are expected to close in the ongoing quarter. Each of these acquisitions are expected to boost the company's revenues and growth prospects.\nETFs to Watch\nGiven Cisco earnings results, ETFs having the largest allocation to this network giant will be in focus for the days ahead. Investors should closely monitor the movement in these funds and grab the opportunity when it arises or avoid if the stocks drags them down (see: all the Technology ETFs here ):\niShares North American Tech-Multimedia Networking ETF ( IGN )\nThis ETF provides a concentrated exposure to the domestic multimedia networking securities by tracking the S&P North American Technology-Multimedia Networking Index. Holding 24 securities in its basket, Cisco takes the top spot with an 8.9% allocation. The product has a definite tilt toward small cap securities that account for 45%, followed by mid caps at 38%. The fund has accumulated $138.8 million in its asset base while sees a light volume of around 20,000 shares a day. Expense ratio comes in at 0.48%. The fund has added 0.3% in the year-to-date time frame and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 or 'Buy' rating with a High risk outlook.\nFirst Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund ( TDIV )\nThis fund provides exposure to the dividend payers in the technology sector by tracking the Nasdaq Technology Dividend Index. The product has amassed about $490.2 million in its asset base and trades in good volume of about 120,000 shares per day. The ETF charges 50 bps in annual fees and holds about 99 securities in its basket. Of these firms, CSCO occupies the third position, making up roughly 8.3% of the assets. In terms of industrial exposure, the fund allocates nearly one-fifth portion in semiconductor and semiconductor equipment, followed by software (16.9%), diversified telecom services (14.8%), technology hardware, storage & peripherals (14.6%), and communications equipment (14.0%). The fund is down 5.1% so far this year (read: 3 Dirt Cheap High Dividend ETFs to Watch ).\nFirst Trust NASDAQ CEA Cybersecurity ETF ( CIBR )\nThis ETF follows the Nasdaq CEA Cybersecurity Index, which measures the performance of companies engaged in the cyber security segment of the technology and industrials sectors. It has successfully accumulated nearly $97.4 million in its asset base since its debut in July. The fund charges 60 bps and trades in good average daily volume of about 105,000 shares. In total, the product holds 34 stocks in its basket with Cisco taking the second spot at 6.4%. It is skewed toward software industry at 44.8%, while communications equipment and Internet software & services round off the top three with double-digit allocation each. The fund has lost 11% since its inception (read: Cybersecurity Threats from China Persist: ETFs in Focus ).\nPowerShares Dynamic Networking Portfolio ( PXQ )\nThis fund follows the Dynamic Networking Intellidex Index, holding 30 securities in its basket. Out of these, Cisco is the third firm accounting for 5.2% share. From a sector look, communication equipment dominates the fund's portfolio at 42% of the assets, followed by 40% in software and programming. The fund is less popular and illiquid in the broad tech space with AUM of $26.8 million and average daily volume of about 5,000 shares.

The adjusted earnings per share figure excludes one-time items but includes stock-based compensation expenses.\nNevertheless, Cisco's shares plunged 5.1% due to weaker-than-expected revenue and earnings guidance for the upcoming quarter.\nRevenues\nRevenues decreased 1.3% sequentially but increased 3.6% year over year to $12.7 billion and came slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.6 billion. The healthy growth in several product lines led to the improvement.\nOn a year-over-year basis, products (78% of total revenue) were up 4.3% to $9.8 billion and Services (22%) rose 1% to $2.8 billion. Product book-to-bill ratio was below 1.\nProduct Revenues by Category\nSwitching (32%), Collaboration (9%), Security (4%) and Other Products (1%) segments increased 8.1%, 2.5%, 4.5% and 27.1%, respectively, on a sequential basis.\nHowever, this increase was offset by sequentially weak performance by NGN Routing (14%), Data Center (7%), Service Provider Video (7%), Wireless (5%), and Service (22%) which declined 10%, 2.4%, 14.5%, 9.8% and 3.2%, respectively.\nRevenues by Geography\nRevenues decreased sequentially across all geographies. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) declined 0.7%, Asia-Pacific, Japan and China (collectively known as APJC) was down 7% while the Americas dipped 0.03%.\nOrders\nThough management did not provide much detail about orders, CEO Chuck Robbins stated that order growth was hit by \"uncertainty of the macro environment\".\nGross Margin\nPro-forma gross margin was 62.8%, up 111 basis points (bps) sequentially but flat year over year.\nCisco's operating expenses of $4.5 billion decreased 2.3% sequentially and 1.1% year over year. Research & development as well as sales & marketing expenses decreased slightly, as a percentage of sales, from the year-ago quarter, while general and administrative expenses increased marginally. The net result was an operating margin of 27.7%, up 4.3% sequentially and 9.6% year over year.\nNet Income\nCisco Systems Inc. - Earnings Surprise |     FindTheBest\nOn a GAAP basis, Cisco recorded a net profit of $2.4 billion or 48 cents per share compared with $1.8 billion or 35 cents last year. On a pro-forma basis, the company generated adjusted net profit of $2.75 billion as against $2.51 billion a year ago.\nOur pro-forma figure excludes certain one-time items but includes stock-based compensation expenses.\nBalance Sheet\nCisco exited the quarter with cash and investments balance of $59.1 billion as against $60.4 billion in the prior quarter. Trade receivables were $4.7 billion, down from $5.3 billion in the earlier quarter. Total debt (short-term and long-term) was $24.6 billion compared with $25.4 billion last quarter.\nThe company generated operating cash flow of $2.8 billion and spent $0.3 billion on capital expenditure, netting a free cash flow of $2.5 billion.\nShare Repurchase & Dividend\nDuring the quarter, Cisco paid $1.1 billion as dividend.\nThe company bought back approximately 4.5 billion shares under the repurchase program at an average price of $20.92 a share or a total of $93.9 billion.\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2016, Cisco expects revenues to increase in the range of 0% to 2% on a year-over-year basis. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin is expected within 62-63% and operating margin in the range of 28.5-29.5% of revenues. The company expects non-GAAP tax rate of 23%, yielding non-GAAP earnings per share of 53 cents to 55 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 50 cents.\nOur Take\nDespite intensifying competition from several smaller players, Cisco remains strong in its domain. The company reported decent first-quarter results with both the top line and the bottom line exceeding the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nHowever, the company gave a weak guidance due to unfavorable exchange rates across the Asia-Pacific region and weak spending environment in China.\nCisco's strategy of diversifying its business by introducing software-based networking tools and security services, and relying less on specialized routers and switching equipment appears to be yielding results.\nDuring the quarter, Cisco acquired cloud-based security provider, OpenDNS. This will help the company to enhance cloud security offerings by leveraging increased visibility and threat awareness offered by OpenDNS' cloud delivered platform. Also, the company's partnership with Apple, Inspur and Ericsson will drive growth.\nHowever, weakness in a few emerging markets and slower growth across various product categories could impact profitability in the near term.\nCisco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Extreme Networks Inc. EXTR , Netgear Inc. NTGR and Lantronix, Inc. LTRX . All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
