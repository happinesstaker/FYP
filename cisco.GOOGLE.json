The monthly bar chart of Cisco ( CSCO - Get Report ) below puts the rallies from 2011, 2009 and even 2002 into longer-term perspective.\nClick here to see the following chart in a new window\nThe 2002 low completed the first phase of the corrective decline from the 2000 peak, which had followed a parabolic rise in the stock's price. Ralph Elliott, of Elliott Wave fame, taught that parabolic rallies always crash back to the origin of the parabola. Although this price level was achieved at the 2002 low (labeled purple A-circled), the pattern since then is anything but impulsive. \u00a0\nMust Read: 5 Toxic Stocks to Sell Now\nThis warns, with a probability of more than 90%, that at least a test of the 2002 low is due before the final corrective action off the 2000 peak ends. The 2007 peak is where the purple B-circled is placed, but the 2015 highs are an equally valid place for the entire bounce off the 2002 lows to be considered mature. Regardless, the next multiyear trend is highly likely to be downward, with either the 2002 lows retested, or those of 1997. Then, conditions will be in place, along with the pattern, to conclude that a new bull market is beginning. \u00a0\nCurrently, however, conditions are flashing signs of a peak and reversal. As long as $29.50 remains unbroken, our\u00a0 decision support engine tells us that the time for buying is over, and selling must be considered. If you're long, use $25.50 as your sell stop, before the next shoe drops on Cisco and you wish you'd exited in the $20s. If you're flat, either a retest of $27.50 or a break below $25.50 is ideal to establish short exposure. If you're short, maintain and/or add to your exposure. \u00a0\nFor more of this kind of analysis, join our new real-time, live-market analysis chat room .

( NASDAQ:CSCO ) spokesman Nigel Glennie recently talked to Bloomberg and refuted reports that the American tech giant wants to buy Ericsson. This claim was made by the Swedish newspaper, Dagens Industri after Cisco announced its collaboration with the Swedish communications company.\nThe alliance is expected to last 10 years, during which both companies intend to synergize each other\u2019s expertise to gain incremental revenues and earnings. The deal involves many aspects of \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d including the creation of a network of mobility, and cloud infrastructure. As such, the multi-faceted nature of the deal has some reporters believe that a possible acquisition is on the cards. The bid, if Cisco would have placed one to buy Ericsson (ADR) ( NASDAQ:ERIC ), would be the largest in Swedish history.\nAnother important factor that brought some life to these merger speculations was John Chambers\u2019 visit to Stockholm, Sweden. The former Cisco CEO was said to be sweet-talking Ericsson executives into being acquired by the company. Mr. Chambers was replaced by Chuck Robbins as the company\u2019s CEO on July 27 this year, though he still serves as Executive Chairman.\nLast Monday, Ericsson was reported to give an Intellectual Property presentation to Cisco, regarding the cooperation agreement between them. On Tuesday, Mr. Chambers in Sweden\u2019s capital, Stockholm, officially cleared the air about the said cooperation, along with Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg.\nAccording to Dagens Industri, Ericsson Chairman, Leif Johansson, is under pressure as the company, despite being dominant in Sweden, will not likely be able to defend itself against any possible bid from Cisco. However, Mr. Glennie stated that Cisco is currently only focused on the partnership, and is not interested in buying Ericsson.\n\"As our executives have said this week, other types of transactions were never on the table,\" Cisco\u2019s spokesman stated. \"We\u2019re excited about the strategic partnership we announced on Monday and the potential it offers for both companies.\"\nHowever, according to Ericsson\u2019s spokeswoman, Minako Nakatsuma Olofzon, the company hasn\u2019t commented on such reports. She only highlighted upon her company\u2019s excitement over the alliance.\nThe partnership strategy seems a good fit to Cisco\u2019s history, which apparently prefers to focus on taking over smaller companies, while collaborating with bigger ones. In the conference call on Monday, it was repeatedly expressed that the alliance allows the companies to start delivering products and services swiftly, which is not possible in a merger case.\n", "title": "Is Cisco Buying Ericsson? - Bidness ETC"}, {"article": "Markets\nIt\u2019s Time to Reconnect With Cisco\nThe networking equipment maker\u2019s new leadership, partnership approach and reasonable valuation suggest the stock is worth a look.\nBy\nNov. 11, 2015 3:40 p.m. ET\nThe new kid on the block is already making friends.\nCisco Systems Inc.

This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, solid stock price performance, notable return on equity, increase in net income and good cash flow from operations.

After the debacle last week from FireEye ( FEYE ), the report seems to lend support to his positive outlook for the security industry overall:\nAfter DeWalt and FireEye yelled fire in a crowded theater last week with their earnings debacle and blamed weakness more on industry softness than company specific issues, the Street is now reaching \u201cpanic levels\u201d around the cyber security space and the stocks are under pressure accordingly. Is this epic multi-year cyber security spending run over? That is the main question we continue to be asked by nervous tech investors who are still feeling the aftershocks of DeWalt\u2019s comments and FireEye\u2019s shocker. To this point, the answer is no as we continue to point to massive strength in firewall spending and next generation cyber security initiatives (UTM, endpoint, email, database security) heading into 2016, while \u201cemergency security spending\u201d has ticked down which clearly impacts FireEye more than any other vendor. Cisco security share gains have subsided as the company has finally figured out the right formula/better execution and now the focus is on identifying the winners in the land grab opportunity for this $30 billion cyber pie over the next three years. We believe Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint, Splunk (big data/security), Check Point, Imperva, and Fortinet remain front and center as winners with now all eyes on Cisco\u2019s M&A strategy in security and if FireEye (and possibly Fortinet among others) now becomes a legitimate target in 2016 for Robbins as he looks to significantly expand Cisco\u2019s security footprint in this fertile market for years to come.\nOn a less sanguine note,\u00a0Amit Daryanani\u00a0with RBC Capital Markets\u00a0thinks there are some negative implications for the realm of contract manufacturers such as Flextronics\u00a0( FLEX ) and Celestica ( CLS ):\nWe believe Jan-qtr guidance implies modest downside risk for supply chain companies in Dec/March-qtr; while the revenue guide isn\u2019t a direct negative, the risk we see is that CSCO may curtail inventory levels and that could dampen out quarter revenue contribution for supply chain companies. CSCO exposure: CLS: 10%+ of sales via routers. FLEX: ~6-8% of sales via switches, routers, and infrastructure equipment. JBL: ~7\u20139% of sales via routers and switches, APH: ~4% of sales, TEL: ~2%. CLS implications: The Communications segment (41% of sales) increased +2% q/q in Sept-qtr. The company expects this segment should be flat on a sequential basis. We believe CSCO\u2019s guide is in line to modest negative with CLS\u2019s expectations on a q/q basis. Net: Neutral to modest negative for CLS. Sales in FLEX\u2019s Integrated Network Solutions (INS) segment (35% of sales) were up +12%q/q (-6% y/y) in the Sept-qtr. This segment is expected to up mid to high single-digits sequentially in Dec-qtr. We view Cisco\u2019s guidance as slightly worse than FLEX\u2019s expectation on a q/q basis for the segment \u2013 though we think FLEX\u2019s strength is driven by 5 new ramps in the segment and doesn\u2019t imply organic/legacy trends improving. Net: Slight negative for FLEX.\nMost of these names today traded down with the broad market decline. Flextronics shares were down 8 cents, or 0.7%, at $11.05. Celestica stock closed down 16 cents, or 1.5%, at $10.83. Shares of FireEye closed up 2 cents at $22.25.
